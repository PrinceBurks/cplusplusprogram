 This project lets a user search an item and return the quantity of that item from a list, 
 This Allows to user to quickly retrieve accurate data, rather then searching the list one by one.
 The code for this program was very well written, with the function to search and save being easily readable
and effecient, ;eaving very little room for improvement. The more challenging part of writing this program would
probably be the timing for the loops, which tells the code when to enter and exit the loop. I overcame this challenge
by taking a second to fully understand and realize when the loop could start and end and make my code reflect that specifically.
I believe that all the skills learned with this project can transfer to other projects and course work because they are the most
fundamental coding logics that will be used in any program. This program was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using 
seperate functions for each operation as well as comments to explain the actions being performed.
